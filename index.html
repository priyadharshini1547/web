                <h2>Action and Adventure</h2>
                <p> Action and adventure books constantly have you on the edge of your seat with excitement, 
                    as your fave main character repeatedly finds themselves in high stakes situations. 
                    The protagonist has an ultimate goal to achieve and is always put in risky, often dangerous situations. 
                    This genre typically crosses over with others like mystery, crime, sci-fi, and fantasy.</p><br/>

                <h2>Classics</h2>
                <p>You may think of these books as the throwback readings you were assigned in English class.
                     (Looking at you, Charles Dickens.) The classics have been around for decades, and were often 
                     groundbreaking stories at their publish time, but have continued to be impactful for generations,
                    serving as the foundation for many popular works we read today.</p>
                <h2>Comic Book or Graphic Novel</h2>
                <p>The stories in comic books and graphic novels are presented to the reader through engaging,
                     sequential narrative art (illustrations and typography) that's either presented in a specific 
                     design or the traditional panel layout you find in comics. With both, you'll often find the dialogue
                      presented in the tell-tale "word balloons" next to the respective characters.</p>
